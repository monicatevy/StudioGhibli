# Studio Ghibli App

This is a very simple web app with plain Javascript that will retrieve information from an API and display it on the page. I didn't use any build tools or framework which may confuse me about what's happening in it's simpliest form.

## Demo

https://monicatevy.github.io/StudioGhibli/

## Goals
* Learn what a Web API is
* How to use the HTTP request GET with Javascript
* Create and display HTML elements with Javascript
* Learn what the JSON format is
* Understand the difference between the DOM and the HTML source code

### What I learnt
- JS
  - document.createElement()
  - element.setAttribute()
  - element.textContent
  - element.appendChild
  - new XMLHttpRequest()
  - request.open('GET')
  - request.onload
  - request.send()
  - JSON.parse()
  - split() / join()
  - attribute 'onerror' (alt image)
- HTML / CSS
  - overflow
  - insert SVG in CSS (url encoder)

### What I need to work on
- Media Queries
  - design for mobile first before designing for desktop
- Make the page load faster
  - compression
  -minify CSS
- DOM
  - make changes on element when page and external ressources are loaded
